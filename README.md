## SQL: Table Creation in Snowflake
This is a simple table creation I did using Snowflake SQL based platform. The data ingestion was done using the snowflake interface, since it's a
slowly changing dimetion I uploaded the data in CSV file and backfilled the rest of the environments using a CI/CD pipeline created by one of my
colleages.

## Python: Training Codility
This is a demo task for codility. Write a function: that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A. 
For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.
Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.
Given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.
