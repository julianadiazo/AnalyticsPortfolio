## SQL: World Cup Scoring
This is a project I did for fun in one of my SQL practice sessions. The code scores a ranking based on the scores between teams. It takes into account wins, losses and ties.
You can find the code here https://github.com/julianadiazo/SQL/blob/main/ForFun/WorldCup

## SQL: Table Creation in Snowflake
This is a simple table creation I did using Snowflake SQL based platform. The data ingestion was done using the snowflake interface, since it's a
slowly changing dimetion I uploaded the data in CSV file and backfilled the rest of the environments using a CI/CD pipeline created by one of my
colleages.

2. Data Backfill: https://github.com/julianadiazo/SQL/blob/main/Professional/Snowflake/BackfillForSnowflakeTable

## SQL: View Creation in Snowflake

This is a view created on top of several tables availablen in the Snowflake Architecture for the project I was working on. This view was created specifically to pull data for a Power BI report. The code has been altered for security reasons.
You can find the code here: https://github.com/julianadiazo/SQL/blob/main/Professional/Snowflake/ViewCreation.sql

## Python: Training Codility
This is a demo task for codility. Write a function: that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A. 
For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.
Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.
Given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.
More info can be found here: https://github.com/julianadiazo/Python/blob/main/Training/CodilityNumbersDemo.py

## Snowflake Infrastructure
This is a Hands on Demo that I did during training for Snowflake, it includes most of the capabilities snowflake has in a very light level, including but no limited to ingesting data using AWS S3, creating databases, schemas, tables etc.
